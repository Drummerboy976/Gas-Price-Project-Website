                        <p>Electric cars are a great alternative if you are looking to save money on gas but are not able to use public transportation. For this example, we can look at a Hyundai Kona (gas vs electric versions). The average cost per 45k miles is $5,162 for the gas version while the electric version will run about $2548. If you're looking into a truck, the F-150 will run you $8325 while it's electric counterpart is about $4,529.</p>

                    <p>Owning a motorcycle is another great way to help save costs. The majority of motorcycles get better gas mileage than standard cars while carrying smaller tanks. Insurance for motorcycles tend to cost around the same as cars or less, depending on the type of motorcycle you own. Riding a motorcycle will require you to buy safety gear to protect yourself. Motorcycle gear would include a helmet, gloves, motorcycle jacket, some armor padded pants, and some hard material boots. Good motorcycle gear would cost somewhere between $1,000 to $2,000 to keep a rider well protected. Lastly, because of the easy accessibility to the motorcycle's components, most motorcycle owners learn to do the basic maintenance on their motorcycles. This is encouraged to help lower the costs of basic maintenance.</p>

                        <p>Bicycles are a great way to get around most big cities like Los Angeles. It's already a great way to get your workout in. An average entry level road bike can run you anywhere from $1000-$2000. That's not to say you can't get anything cheaper, but generally this is a great price point to start. It may seem steep at first, but the fact that you wont be fueling up every few days will start to pay off quickly.</p>

                        <p>Though not as good as some of the east coast rail systems, Los Angeles has a decent enough rail system that will let you travel around downtown los angeles and the surrounding areas. Within the next few years, the system will be expanded to reach the west-side. A 30 day pass is $122 which includes unlimited rail plus bus rides. But as a college student, there are some schools enrolled in the U-Pass program which will provide even better rates. For example, Cal State LA is part of this program and offers a U-Pass for $125 and is good for 5 months. </p>

                        <p>Los Angeles' metro bus system is surprisingly good and can get you almost anywhere in the city. You can also mix and match, using both the bus and the subway system to get around. A 1-way trip is $1.75, but if you plan on using it as your main source of getting around, then getting the 30 day pass which is $50 as of November 2022 - and if you're a college student you can get the pass for $43 which is less than a full tank of gas. They also have a great website that lets you plan your destination and will give you the correct bus lines, transfers, and times to get there.</p>
